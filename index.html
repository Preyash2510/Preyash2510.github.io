					<h1>Creation!</h1>
					<p>
						Internet was the thought of J.C.R. Licklider. He proposed an idea in 1960, where all of the computers in the world are connected to each other. So, the government thinking of this idea created a program called the ARPANET. ARPANET stands for, Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. ARPANET had two computer connected to each other, one at UCLA and one at Stanford. In 1969, the first message was sent “LOGIN”, but only “LO” returned. There were still problems communicating because if one computer failed the entire network failed. So to solve these problems the Internet Protocol was created. Internet Protocol was created by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, also known as the Father of Internet. They broke the message into different packets and sent it across the network, so if one computer breaks down other still communicate.

						Internet works by breaking up the data into multiple packets and sent it across the network and displaying it on to the computer. The networks consist of powerful computers which can send data across the entire globe, they are the Servers. The server is at everyone's house the router that you have is the server for your house. When you want to search something on Google, your router will ask the google server to access the data that it contains in its data storage. However, to find a single server amongst a million servers is a problematic job for a router. So internet use address called the Internet Protocol or IP. although the Google can show you the result under a second, the most amazing thing about this process is that the router has to ask a lot of servers to get to Google's server itself.

					<h3>Programing!</h3>
					<p>
						Although the internet is amazing, it is still only 1s and 0s. A human cannot read this type of language, so we created browsers like Chrome, Safari,  or Firefox. However, to make a website we needed to create our own language in which we can read it and put data on the internet. So, we created the three main programing language to help us put data on the internet and the web. In 1954, FORTRAN was created by John Backus to program the internet, it the father to the most important internet programing language, HTML. Then came, CSS and then JavaScript. These languages changed the world.

						HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, the same person who invent web or WWW. HTML was created at the last expected place in the CERN lab, it is a lab for particle physics. It was created to collaborate the documents of other scientists around the world through internet. HTML became really popular because it could allow other documents to connect in one, like a Hyperlink, Hyperlink soon came to be known as Hypertext. This was the reason why HTML became popular because it allowed the user to go different pages from one. Otherwise, the user would have to search everything that they wanted to see, BORING!

					<h2>Importance!</h2>

						HTML is the MOST IMPORTANT programing language in the web development world. Since is a markup language, it holds every single element together. Without HTML you cannot put anything on the web, because it is the first thing the web read and then it knows where to look for a particular thing. As we know that www was created by Tim Berners-Lee, so he made it in such a way that the web can only read HTML first and then any other files connected to the website. HTML’s only job is to hold everything together and also keep the content in it. You cannot put content in any other file then HTML. So basically, HTML is a house in the people live in and it held them together.

						Although, HTML is very important to in the process of making the website. It has one downside, it cannot make elements presentable. To solve this problem, in 1994 Håkon Wium Lie, Bert Bos and the WWW Consortium, developed CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Styling Sheet, it is a style sheet file. There were other styling sheets before CSS, but they only worked for a specific browser. Tim Berners-Lee didn’t want that and so him and his colleague Håkon Wium Lie, created CSS. It was a major hit, because worked on any browser and required fewer codes to decorate something.

							CSS is important because it allows your website looks good, instead of a crappy one. CSS can allow you to make a lot of cool effect like 3d effect, animations, etc. Because of these effects, CSS became popular amongst developer. As you see the effect on the left.

					CSS helped create cool effects and at some point animations too. However, these effects came with a cost that developer had to pay. It consumed a lot of time and effort, and also there really really long codes, and it only helps create few effects not all. So, to make more effects possible, Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995. It only took him 10 days to create an entire programing language, Cool!

					<h2>Little Bit More!</h2>
					<p>
						As people started to understand JavaScript, they started to invent new effects that were never seen before on the web. However, they had to write a lot of code, but they also wanted to share these effects with the developer. For this reason, JavaScript experts created files which were called libraries. This libraries contents all of them .JS file needed to achieve that effect. After releasing the libraries the users just of connect there.JS file into the “head” section of their HTML file.
